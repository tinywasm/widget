// Capped bounds the element's block size against the viewport, so that a

// RELATIVE, so all four are inert until some ancestor has a DEFINITE block
// size. A panel left at its content height has none: the percentage resolves
// against an indefinite height and falls back to auto, flex-grow finds no
// free space to claim, and the region grows to fit its content instead of
// scrolling. Nothing looks broken in the stylesheet; the list simply pushes
// the page down and the WHOLE app scrolls under the user's thumb.
//
// An in-flow panel usually inherits a bound from its layout. An out-of-flow

// of (that it feeds width, and a 0% fallback) but never assigns a value to —
// a stylesheet builder works on a zero-value receiver, so a per-instance
// fill level cannot be baked in. The host sets ONLY the value at runtime,
