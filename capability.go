// Filterable is implemented by a control that narrows a host's collection: a
// search bar, a date picker, a category select. The host registers one sink and
// the control calls it whenever the term changes.
//
// The term is a plain string because that is what the consuming end takes
// (view.Presenter.Filter(term string)). A calendar formats its range into a
// term; a select emits the chosen id. Widening this to a structured query is a
// change to that contract, not to this one.
//
// The host registers the sink once, at wiring time, and never reads it back —
// which is why this is a setter and not a field: a control is free to fan the
// sink out to several inputs, or to debounce it, without the host knowing.
type Filterable interface{ OnFilterChange(func(term string)) }
